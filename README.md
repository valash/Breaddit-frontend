# Breaddit

## Front-end

### Description

Breaddit is a Reddit clone for all of your bread-themed needs.

Breaddit is a social news website to keep you up-to-date on all things loaf, bread puns? We got em. International Bread Scandals? âœ… Bready-to-make recipes? You know it!

In today's climate, everything is too focused on politics, money, Millennials, and we saw a very LARGE problem in our society. There was nowhere to go for people to share bread things to their little sourdough heart's desire. Breaddit is here to change that.
